# Weather-Dashboard
Weather Dashboard allows the user to enter the name of a city and the current conditions and 5 day forecast are displayed. The city names are displayed as buttons and the user can quickly get the forecast for that city by clicking on the button.

## Description

* Upon start, an outline of the dashboard is displayed with an input field for the city name

* When the user clicks "Get Forecast", the name of the city and today's date is displayed with an icon reflecting the current weather.

* Today's temperature, humidity and windspeed are displayed.  The UV Index is displayed and is color coded depending on the potential risk of the UV.  Green is safe, yellow is moderate and red is dangerous.

* Below, the forecast for the next 5 days are displayed including the date, icon reflecting weather, temp, wind and humidity

* A button is created with the city's name. The button can be clicked at any time to get instant access to the current weather and forecast.

* The button's city names are saved in local storage and are restored when the application starts again.

* The UI is responsive and works at many different screen sizes
